<h2>
    INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p>
John Gwynn, generally accepted as the author of <i>The Art of
Architecture</i> (1742), is best known to students of English literature
as one of the founders of the Royal Academy and as a friend of Samuel
Johnson, who undertook in 1759 to win the Blackfriars Bridge commission
for Gwynn with a series of three letters in the <i>Daily Gazeteer</i><a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a>.
To  architectural historians Gwynn is best known as the architect whose
proposals for regularizing the street plans of London and Westminster
(in <i>London and Westminster Improved</i>, 1766) were prophetic both of the
plan which eventually emerged from the land speculation and building
boom of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and of the prominence
subsequently given to city-planning.<a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> But like Dr. Johnson, Gwynn
looked as much to the past as he anticipated the future. This is almost
inevitable since he too spans the years which saw the last expressions
of humanist principles of art and the first struggles to find new bases
for aesthetic judgments. Although the date of Gwynn's birth is unknown,
he must have been almost an exact contemporary of Dr. Johnson, for he
also began his literary career in the 1730's, gained public recognition
in the 1750's, associated with members of the Literary Club in the
1760's, and died slightly over a year after Johnson, probably on 27
February 1786.
</p>
<p>
Their careers exhibit two more instructive parallels. Both began
as amateurs, possessed of no specific training, and ended as
self-supporting "professionals," able to exercise their skills on
demand and fully conscious of the qualifications needed for membership
within their professions.<a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> Second, both began with the hope of
"fixing" the rules of their arts, but ended by disavowing the intention
or by implicitly contradicting it. Johnson records his disillusionment
with one such attempt in the "Preface" to his <i>Dictionary</i> (1755).
Gwynn's continuing interest in the attempt is evident in his early
proposals for establishing an art academy (<i>An Essay on Design</i>, 1749)
and in his serving as a representative of the architectural profession
in the founding of the Royal Academy. However his efforts

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemii" name="pagemii"></a>[pg ii]</span>

                                                          late in his
career to accommodate his early principles to the needs of a nation in
the midst of an economic and a building boom reveal a considerable
shift from his dogmatic support of the rules of art in <i>The Art of
Architecture</i>.
</p>
<p>
The poem is significant in a number of ways. It is the work of a young,
inexperienced architect, with literary ambitions, who has learned most
of what he knows about the principles of his art from published
sources&mdash;treatises, pattern books, and measured drawings&mdash;rather than
in an architect's studio or in a master mason's stone-cutting yard.
Take, for example, one of his lists of architects worthy of study:
"With <i>M&mdash;&mdash;s, F&mdash;&mdash;ft, G&mdash;&mdash;s, L&mdash;&mdash;i, W&mdash;&mdash;e</i>,/ Let <span class="sc">Admiralty</span>,
or <span class="sc">Custom-house</span> compare" (p. 18). Four of these architects published
treatises or translations of treatises which Gwynn certainly knew:
Robert Morris, <i>Lectures on Architecture</i>, 1734-36<a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>; James Gibbs,
<i>Rules for Drawing the Several Parts of Architecture</i>, 1733; James
Leoni, translations of Palladio, 1715-16, and of Alberti, 1726; Isaac
Ware, translation of Palladio, 1737. The other architect referred to is
Henry Flitcroft. The poem is, secondly, an unusually clear expression
of the architectural principles&mdash;and dilemmas&mdash;of a man who is
sensitive to changes in taste and in artistic practice, but unaware of
the causes of the changes, and probably incapable of grasping their
significance. This is precisely what makes <i>The Art of Architecture</i> a
valuable document in the history of eighteenth-century criticism. The
poem provides a brief but rather full summary of the major precepts
of humanist architectural theory accepted in the first half of the
century, and introduces an important English innovation. At the same
time it reveals the passionate desperation of a man confident in his
rules of art but powerless to impose them upon a society enamored of
novelty. Gwynn never gave up his youthful ambition of improving English
building, but he did give up the positiveness evident in this poem.
</p>
<p>
Gwynn's general critical bias is readily identifiable because it is
consistent with that of many conventionally trained architects of the
1720's and 1730's, and with that of most propagandists for English
Palladianism. Like the Earl of Burlington, William Kent, Colin
Campbell, Morris, Ware, and Alexander Pope, Gwynn venerated Inigo Jones
as England's Palladio, as the architect who showed how Palladio's rules
could be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemiii" name="pagemiii"></a>[pg iii]</span>

         naturalized for the English climate (pp. 14, 25). Similarly
orthodox is his opinion of the fanciful baroque architecture of Sir
John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, both of whom are held up as
perpetrators of tasteless, licentious innovation (pp. 14, 26). The more
chaste baroque architects&mdash;Sir Christopher Wren, Gibbs, and Thomas
Archer&mdash;Gwynn generally admires, although he recognizes occasional
flaws in the works of Gibbs and Archer (pp. 14, 29). In remarking on
his other "villain" architects, Gwynn reveals his political preferences
and some acquaintance with current scandals. At least two of them were
aligned with the court party. Thomas Ripley, a one-time carpenter who
was one of Pope's targets of satire, erected Houghton for Robert
Walpole in accordance with designs by Campbell (pp. 15, 17).<a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> Edward
Oakley dedicated his <i>Magazine of Architecture</i>, <i>Perspective and
Sculpture</i> (1730) to Walpole, but received no posts such as those which
Ripley, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh, or John James enjoyed under the Walpole
administration (p. 28). Two more architects whom he mentions, besides
Gibbs, Vanbrugh, and Ripley, were employed on the notorious projects of
the Duke of Chandos&mdash;John James and Andrew Shepherd (pp. 10, 23).<a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
Gwynn's taste and principles were those of an educated elite to which
he did not belong&mdash;conventional in their moral and aesthetic
implications, and conservative in their political ones.
</p>
<p>
But the significance of <i>The Art of Architecture</i> is not merely as
evidence of contemporary attitudes toward Hawksmoor or James, Chapman
or Banks. It is rather what Gwynn believes they indicate: the failure
to establish in England a building practice firmly based upon a body of
principles which architects and men of letters in the first half of
the eighteenth century had wanted to believe inviolable. The Palladian
revival had helped to subvert the medieval crafts tradition in building
(which had been vigorous through the seventeenth century) and had
contributed to substituting for the pomp and flamboyance of the baroque
a taste for regularity in outline, clear relationship of parts, and a
relative simplicity of surface and ornament. Accompanying it was an
unprecedented deluge of publications, all of which helped to create a
greater popular consciousness of humanist architectural principles than
had previously existed. Yet the revival was proving ineffectual, and
perhaps the clearest evidence is in Gwynn's attack on Kent: "See the
old <span class="sc">Goths</span>,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemiv" name="pagemiv"></a>[pg iv]</span>

                    in <i>K&mdash;&mdash;</i>'s Designs survive;/ And Modern <span class="sc">Fools</span>, to
imitate his strive" (p. 26). Kent edited the drawings of the English
Palladio for the Earl of Burlington (<i>The Designs of Inigo Jones, With
Some Additional Designs</i>, 1727); but at Esher Place, Surrey (ca. 1730),
and again in Merlin's Cave, erected at Richmond Park for Queen Caroline
(1735), he "anticipate[d] by twenty years the rococo Gothic of the
1750's."<a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> The latter design was even published with some by Jones two
years after <i>The Art of Architecture</i> in John Vardy's <i>Some Designs of
Mr. Inigo Jones and Mr. William Kent</i> (1744). Clearly Vitruvius's rule
of <i>decor</i> had not restrained even the publicists of Palladianism.
</p>
<p>
Humanist architectural theory was losing its authority even as it was
being widely disseminated; it was also, as was only half clear to
Gwynn, becoming increasingly unintelligible. Wealthy patrons of the art
looked more and more upon exact knowledge of it as unbefitting the
learning of a gentleman. Archaeological studies of antiquities, instead
of helping to fix the rules of proportion, were contributing to
aesthetic relativity by demonstrating the disparity between ancient
practice and Vitruvius's rules. Claude Perrault attempted to resolve
these disparities by a system of mathematical averages, but the result
of his empirical method is only to substitute one source of relativity
for another.<a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> By the 1740's what Rudolf Wittkower has called the
"break-away from the laws of harmonic proportion"<a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> was well under
way, and it represented but a part of the collapse of the several
systems of arithmetic and geometric proportion which had dominated
humanist theory. Developments in the history of thought made this
collapse inevitable. The old aesthetics were based upon correspondences
between divine and human artifacts. Thus in designing a building the
architect emulated the Divine Architect who "ordered all things in
measure and number and weight" (Wisdom 11:20). The geometric forms and
the systems of mathematical and harmonic proportions of a building
answered to those of the cosmos; likewise the aesthetic attributes
of the cosmos&mdash;with their attendant moral ones&mdash;such as symmetry,
uniformity, regularity, and fitness had their correspondences in
architecture. Such assumptions provided immutable bases for the rules
external to the individual work of art, but the breakdown of analogical
reasoning in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries necessarily
undermined such philosophical-theological foundations. The new

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemv" name="pagemv"></a>[pg v]</span>

 epistemology, further, shifted attention from the external world&mdash;the
previous source of the rules&mdash;to the mind perceiving it.
</p>
<p>
By the 1740's consciousness was growing of threats against the ethical
and aesthetic values of Renaissance humanism (best expressed in Pope's
<i>Dunciad in Four Books</i>), and of the consequent need for new sources
of  authority for the rules of art. One highly eccentric quest for
authority was published just a year before <i>The Art of Architecture</i>:
John Wood's <i>The Origins of Building</i>; or, <i>The Plagiarism of the
Heathens Detected</i> (1741). Wood reconstructs the history of
architecture to make it conform to Old Testament chronology. Thus he
attributes the major tenets of Vitruvius's architectural theory to
various patriarchs and ancient Jewish heroes, or, when he finds
any justification for doing so, directly to God. Gwynn's attempt
to buttress the rules is far more mundane. He seeks support from
contemporary philosophy; for example, he introduces the epistemological
and ethical systems of Shaftesbury to account for some principles of
decorum, but without perceiving the subjectivity he was imposing on
them. He rationalizes some of Vitruvius's analogies between natural
and architectural forms. But even more clearly indicative of the
futility of his effort are his appeals to authority. He implores such
aristocratic patrons as Pembroke, Chesterfield, and Burlington to "Be
to my <i>Muse</i> a Friend; assist my Cause;/Be Friend to <i>Science</i>, fix'd
on <i>Nature's</i> Laws" (p. 30). Perhaps most important, however, is the
authority of Horace himself, who provides the model for the poem.
</p>
<p>
Although neoclassical critics generally accepted the reality of
correspondences between architectural and literary criticism, Gwynn did
not find the <i>Ars Poetica</i> an entirely manageable model.<a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> Horace's
figures of the mad painter and the mad poet which frame the poem at
either end serve Gwynn well, for his imitations of them as the mad
painter and the mad architect emphasize the personal, social, and
artistic consequences of attempting to build without rules, talent, or
even a clear need to build. But within the poem, allusions to Horace
are often much more elusive. He usually succeeds best in keeping close
to Horace when citing the most general principles. Thus Horace's attack
on bombast and timidity ("professus grandia turget;/serpit humi tutus
nimium timidusque procellae," 11. 27-28) occasions an attack on
misunderstood magnificence and on stodginess:
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemvi" name="pagemvi"></a>[pg vi]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  Others affect <i>Magnificence</i> alone; </p>
<p class="i2">  And rise in large enormous Heaps of Stone; </p>
<p class="i2">  Swell the huge <i>Dome</i>, and <i>Turrets</i> bid to rise, </p>
<p class="i2">  And Towers on Towers; attract the Gazer's Eyes. </p>
<p class="i2">  Some dare not leave the old, the beaten Way, </p>
<p class="i2">  To search new Methods, or in Science stray ... </p>
</div>
<p class="rj">  (p. 8.) </p>
</div>

<p>
Similarly clear are Gwynn's adaptations of such commonplaces as the
need to subordinate parts to the whole (p. 8) or for consistency of
style (p. 15). Again, Horace asks whether a good poem is the product of
nature or art&mdash;of native talent or of training&mdash;and denies that either
is adequate alone (11. 408-418). Gwynn raises the same question about
the architect, although in the first person, and answers,
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  If <i>Art</i>, or <i>Nature</i>, form'd me what I am; </p>
<p class="i2">  If one or both, assisted in the Plan, </p>
<p class="i2">  It is beyond, my utmost Power to say: </p>
<p class="i2">  Whether I <i>Art</i>, or <i>Nature</i>' s Laws obey. </p>
</div>
<p class="rj">  (p. 31.) </p>
</div>

<p>
Since such ambivalence as this is not appropriate to his purpose, he,
unlike Horace, begins almost immediately to stress a course of study
that will result in mastery of the rules.
</p>
<p>
This last rhetorical tactic points to one serious problem which Horace
poses for Gwynn&mdash;that of assuming an appropriate stance for defending
the rules. The tone of Horace's epistle to the Pisos is familiar
without being condescending. He writes as an experienced poet and
critic to fellow writers, delivering his pronouncements freely and
confidently, but without dogmatism. Gwynn is neither an equal writing
to equals nor an experienced architect, confident of his qualifications
to instruct the world. At one moment he acknowledges the "Judgment's
Height" of the addressee (p. 28), the next he holds himself up as
possessing a skill worthy of emulation, and proceeds to deliver a
lesson in the tone of a schoolmaster: "Those Things which seem of
little Consequence,/ And slight and trivial ..." (p. 32). Horace's wit,
his reliance upon his audience to grasp the implications of his many
examples, and his avoidance of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemvii" name="pagemvii"></a>[pg vii]</span>

                               positiveness subvert Gwynn's purpose,
as he reveals frequently in contradictory outbursts and in shifts in
tone. Yet in one important passage Horace provides him with a stance
and a theme which help him prop up the rules. After discussing
pardonable faults (11. 347-365) Horace addresses Piso's elder son,
compliments him for his wisdom and training, and <i>reminds him</i> of the
activities in which mediocrity may be tolerated. This serves as a
contrast to poetry: "mediocribus esse poetis/ non homines, non di,
non concessere columnae" (11. 372-373). For once Horace is almost
uncompromising enough for Gwynn's purposes. He adopts a similarly
magisterial tone, but reorders Horace's materials so that the emphasis
is more fully on this principle:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">    But yet, <i>my Lord</i>, this <i>one</i> important Truth, </p>
<p class="i2">  This Law of <i>Science</i>, which we teach our Youth </p>
<p class="i2">  Even <small>THIS</small>, no Mediocrity admit, </p>
<p class="i2">  <i>Rules</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Reason</i>, <i>all</i> must jointly fit: </p>
<p class="i2">  A <i>Painter</i> may <span class="sc">Raphael's</span> Judgment want, </p>
<p class="i2">  And yet, we some Abilities will grant: ... </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  In <span class="sc">Building</span>, there's no <i>Laws</i> of human Kind, </p>
<p class="i2">  Admit a <i>Medium</i>; to the Artist's Mind, </p>
<p class="i2">  <i>All</i> must be perfect, or 'tis understood, </p>
<p class="i2">  Excessive <i>Ill</i>,&mdash;&mdash;or else sublimely <i>Good</i>. </p>
</div>
<p class="rj">  (pp. 29-30.) </p>
</div>

<p>
Especially significant here is his insistence that the "Law of
<i>Science</i>" will "no Mediocrity admit," for Horace discusses poetic
practice rather than the rules which aid it. Secondly, the belabored
inference drawn from the principle in the final couplet has no
precedent at all in Horace. Gwynn has made every effort to place the
rules outside the realm of human eccentricity and to give them the
stature of "<i>Nature's</i> Laws."
</p>
<p>
Considering that the tenets of humanist architectural theory are
traditionally classified very differently from those of literary
criticism, as Gwynn acknowledges in his "Preface" (p. iii), he manages
to accommodate them surprisingly well to the organization of the <i>Ars
Poetica</i>. A good example is his treatment of Horace's discussion of the
transitoriness of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemviii" name="pagemviii"></a>[pg viii]</span>

                  language, as of all things, and the necessary dominance
of the rules of usage (11. 46-72). The most obvious parallel is the
inevitable ruin of the pompous buildings which men erect (p. 11).
But he develops none of the botanical analogies which Horace used to
illustrate the rhythms of life and death (11. 60-69), for his purpose
is to emphasize instead the parallel between <i>usus</i> and the
architectural concept of "use." Horace insists, "multa renascentur quae
iam cecidere, cadentque/ quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet
usus" (11. 70-71). Gwynn elaborates on this:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  But Use has rais'd the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> Rules, </p>
<p class="i2">  And banish'd <span class="sc">Gothick</span> Practice from the Schools. </p>
<p class="i2">  Use is the Judge, the Law, the Rule of Things, </p>
<p class="i2">  Whence <span class="sc">Arts</span> arose, and whence the <span class="sc">Science</span> springs. </p>
</div>
<p class="rj">  (p. 11)<a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a></p>
</div>

<p>
Horace and Gwynn both think of "use" operating as a kind of historical
necessity causing the resurrection of a rule or a form. Gwynn adds to
this the concept, drawn from Vitruvius and his commentators, that the
rules of architecture prescribe forms which satisfy particular uses and
reflect directly the strengths and limitations of building materials
and techniques. These are the major premises of Gwynn's assertion that
"on <i>Nature's</i> perfect Plan,/ I form my <span class="sc">System</span>" (p. 31). To
buttress this confidence in rules he develops the parallels between
Horace's history of poetry (11. 73-98) and the history of architecture.
Cecrops, the first king of Athens, is to architectural practice what
Homer is to heroic poetry. Daedalus is to the theory of architecture
what Archilochus is to the meter of dramatic poetry (pp. 11-12). The
emphasis on the giving and systematizing of rules, although without
precedent in Horace, reflects the same preoccupation with the authority
of origins as John Wood's <i>Origins of Building</i>, Pope's <i>Essay on
Criticism</i>, or even Locke's <i>Two Treatises on Government</i> for that
matter.
</p>
<p>
Horace provides less precise correspondences for one of the most important
rules. Vitruvius's rule of <i>decor</i> (<i>De Architectura</i>, I, ii, 5) is
only generally parallel to the rules governing decorum of language,
characterization, and genre. Gwynn nevertheless introduces all of its
major implications. It dictates

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemix" name="pagemix"></a>[pg ix]</span>

                                the observing of clear correspondences
between a building's form and its use, inhabitant, and site (or
"situation," to use the eighteenth-century term). It is based upon the
notion that architectural styles have recognizable social, ethical,
religious, and aesthetic attributes. The attributes, which evoke
predictable psychological responses, express the <i>uses</i> which the
styles were created to satisfy and the cultures in which they were
developed. One brief passage beginning "If to adapt your Fabrick, you
would choose,/ To suit the <i>Builder's</i> Genius, or his Use" (pp. 15-16)
effectively summarizes the primary dictates of <i>decor</i>. The architect
has to choose forms and ornaments having attributes in common with the
social station and character traits of the builder of a residence,<a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a>
with the deity to whom a temple is dedicated, with a building's
function, or with the landscape in which it is placed. Thus, for
example, the heavy, plain Tuscan order is appropriate for "A <i>little</i>
Structure; built for Use alone," the "gaiety" of the middle Ionic order
for a country villa, and the "delicacy" of the Corinthian order for an
elegant church or palace (p. 25). An architect's skill is most often
measured in the poem by his adherence to <i>decor</i>.
</p>
<p>
One violator of <i>decor</i> serves as a focus in an important passage
wherein Gwynn tries to integrate Vitruvius and Horace while making a
transition to one of his central concerns, the peculiarly English
reinterpretation of decorum of situation. In discussing the difficulty
of treating traditional subjects in novel ways, Horace compares an
erring "scriptor cyclicus olim" with Homer, summarizes some general
principles, and then turns to a consideration of how to win public
applause (11. 119-178). Gwynn is more suspicious of originality than
Horace (p. 17), and uses Ripley as an example of one who erred in
trying to avoid customary forms. Ripley's Custom House (1718) and
Admiralty building (1723-26) become the equivalent of the Cyclic poet's
bad verse, while Morris, Flitcroft, Gibbs, Leoni, and Ware become the
modern Homers of architecture (p. 18). Gwynn ends the verse paragraph
with Horace's theme of suiting the parts to the whole. With Ripley's
performance as a background Gwynn turns to architecture's most
fundamental rules:
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemx" name="pagemx"></a>[pg x]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">    <span class="sc">Criticks</span>, attend the Rules which I impart; </p>
<p class="i2">  They are at least; <i>instructive</i> to the Art: </p>
<p class="i2">  Mark how <i>Convenience</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Beauty</i> join: </p>
<p class="i2">  With these let <i>Harmony of Parts</i> combine. </p>
</div>
<p class="rj">  (p. 18.) </p>
</div>

<p>
These lines may be construed as the architect's equivalent of Horace's
advice for winning applause. But in fact the entire verse paragraph
which these lines introduce is simply a paraphrase of Vitruvius (I,
iii, 2. Cf. Wotton's remark, "<i>Wel-building</i> hath three Conditions,
<i>Commodity</i>, <i>Firmnesse</i>, and <i>Delight</i>").<a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> The leap which follows
the introduction of these three principles has no precedent in Horace,
but it does in Vitruvius, whose <i>De Architectura</i> is notorious for its
eccentric organization and abrupt transitions. Immediately following
this passage in Vitruvius is his chapter on the "salubrity of sites"
(I, iv).
</p>
<p>
It is ironical that where Gwynn is closest to Vitruvius in one respect
he departs most radically from him in another. Vitruvius's attention
is almost exclusively on the physical requirements of sites for
maintaining men's health and comfort; Gwynn's is on the requirements
for maintaining men's psychological well-being. His conceptions of
decorum of situation begin with Vitruvius and the Renaissance demands
that a site be healthy, that it permit efficient transportation, and
that, if possible, it provide raw materials for building, rich lands
for crops and pastures, and natural beauty conducive to ease and
contemplation. Gwynn emphasizes this last point, building upon
perceptions of nature nourished on Thomson's <i>Seasons</i>, and upon a
psychology drawn largely from the Earl of Shaftesbury (pp. 19-22).
In his earlier <i>Essay on Harmony</i>. <i>As it relates chiefly to Situation
in Building</i> he quotes Shaftesbury on the title page, acknowledges
his debt to Thomson, and quotes long passages from <i>The Seasons</i> to
illustrate various rural "situations."<a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> In <i>The Art of Architecture</i>
he follows Morris's example in writing his own verse in language
imitative of Thomson's (except for one direct quotation, "From the
<i>moist Meadow</i>; to the <i>brown-brow'd Hill</i>"). The verbal precision of
his poetic epithets, and the analysis of perception which they imply,
help to distinguish the sensory, aesthetic, and emotional effects of
a wide variety of disparate experiences, and thus make possible the
identification of those attributes that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagemxi" name="pagemxi"></a>[pg xi]</span>

                                        guide an architect in choosing
a <i>mode</i> appropriate to a site. The perfect fitting of a building
to its site, as of the parts to a whole, will result in what Gwynn
calls "Ideal Harmony," for it "ariseth from such Numbers, Parts, or
Proportions, which may be resolved in the Mind, and ranged together
in Order, by Contemplation."<a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
</p>
<p>
For Gwynn such harmony still has quite clear religious and moral
implications, although he does not, like Morris, attribute to it a
specifically religious function. Yet since the rules are supposedly
based upon natural laws, violations of them betray a failure to
appreciate divine harmony, the highest object of human contemplation.
This accounts for the indignation Gwynn reveals in attacking mad
architects and patrons at the end of the poem, even if it also reveals
his obtuseness in failing to perceive the causes of his outrage.
But, then, Gwynn was no Alexander Pope, either as a poet or as a
thinker.<a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a>

Both James Boswell and Sir John Hawkins briefly discuss Johnson's
relations with Gwynn in their biographies of Johnson. The fullest
accounts of Gwynn's life and professional activities are those in
the <i>DNB</i> and in H. M. Colvin, <i>Biographical Dictionary of English
Architects</i>, 1660-1830 (London, 1954), pp. 254-256. Both attribute the
poem to him. I am much indebted throughout this introduction to Colvin
for information on the architects mentioned in the poem.

For an estimate of the significance of Gwynn's perceptions
see chapter nine of John Summerson's <i>Georgian London</i>, rev. ed.
(Harmondsworth, 1962). His perceptiveness was recognized by the early
nineteenth century. Gregg International published a facsimile reprint
of <i>London and Westminster Improved</i> in 1969.

A work which shows Gwynn's awareness of the differences between the
casual and perhaps well-read dilettante and the dedicated professional
is his essay <i>The Qualifications and Duty of a Surveyor</i> (London,
1752). For discussions of the development of the architectural
profession in eighteenth-century England, see Colvin, pp. 10-25,
and, in spite of his excessively narrow definition of "profession,"

in Britain, A Sociological Study</i> (London, 1960), pp. 39-67.

One indication of Gwynn's admiration for Robert Morris is the title
page of <i>The Art of Architecture</i>. The elevation used as an ornament is
not just modelled on a design by Morris; the plate used to print the
elevation is the very plate, slightly reworked, which printed the
design facing p. 209 in Morris's <i>Lectures</i>. Most of the original
dimension lines have been obliterated, and the original pyramidal roof
has been truncated.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
